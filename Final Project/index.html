			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Welcome to Riding the Rails, a visualization project that explores the ridership patterns of the MBTA system. The MBTA, or Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, is the public transit system that serves the Greater Boston area.<br>
				<br>
				This project is the final submission for ARTG 5330 - Visualization Technology course, an elective course that I took to learn the basics of web-based interactive visualization with a focus on building familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the d3js library, as well as best practices and common patterns in data visualization problem solving.<br>
				<br>
				I chose the MBTA dataset for my project because it is something I could easily relate to, as it is my major means of transportation as an international student who just moved to Boston. I noticed that some lines and stations were more crowded than others, which sparked my curiosity about the patterns of ridership and how they vary across different parts of the city.</p>

			<h3>Dataset & Design Decisions</h3>
			<p>For this project, I used the Subway and Light Rail Transit Ridership dataset from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (massDOT) Mobility Dashboard. This dataset contains daily ridership data for the MBTA subway and light rail system, broken down by station and subway line, from January 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2022.<br>
				<br>
				Before starting the visualization process, I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify any errors or inconsistencies in the data. I also had to clean up the dataset and combine the information into one file, as the data was initially provided for individual stations.<br>
				<br>
				Once the data was cleaned and consolidated, I began to plan the design and visual encodings that I would use to best communicate the insights gleaned from the data. I wanted to make sure that the visualizations were clear, easy to read, and engaging for the viewer. To achieve this, I decided to use a combination of bar charts, line charts, and maps to represent the ridership data and highlight patterns and trends.<br>
				<br>
				In addition, I incorporated interactive features into the visualizations, which allowed the viewer to explore the data further and gain deeper insights into the ridership patterns of the MBTA subway system. By using a narrative approach to the visualization, I aimed to tell a compelling story that would draw the viewer in and help them understand the significance of the data.</p>
