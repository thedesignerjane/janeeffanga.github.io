## Abstract:
This project explores the ridership patterns of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) subway system in the Greater Boston area using the Subway and Light Rail Transit Ridership dataset for 2019-2022, obtained from the MassDOT Mobility Dashboard. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive visualization of the ridership data to understand how ridership varies across different lines, stations, and neighborhoods, and how this changes over time. The project utilizes various visualization techniques, including choropleth and bubble maps, as well as narrative strategies such as interactive elements to allow users to explore the data and draw their own insights.
